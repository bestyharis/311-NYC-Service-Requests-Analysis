Customer Service Requests Analysis

DESCRIPTION
Background
NYC 311's mission is to provide the public with quick and easy access to all New York City government services and information while offering the best customer service. Each day, NYC311 receives thousands of requests related to several hundred types of non-emergency services, including noise complaints, plumbing issues, and illegally parked cars. These requests are received by NYC311 and forwarded to the relevant agencies such as the police, buildings, or transportation. The agency responds to the request, addresses it, and then closes it.

Objective
Perform a service request data analysis of New York City 311 calls. You will focus on the data wrangling techniques to understand the pattern in the data and also visualize the major complaint types
